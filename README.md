## FAQ

### Why make this?
**Short answer:** Curing people should be free. 

**Long answer:** Lowering the barrier of entry to synthetic biology is crucial if we want to make fast progress and cure diseases. Good molecular biology software is really expensive, GeneHacker exists to make sure the best tools for molecular biology are free and opensource! 


### Why is it LGPL-2.1 Licensed?
Because P5.js uses LGPL-2.1 and we use that to draw. (if anyone wants to re-implement everything with an MIT licensed library feel free to do so)

### Where are the tests?
Working on it, feel free to add some.
